# dental_mgt_app
A dental practice requires a software tool to allow them to manage treatments offered, patient details and appointment records. 
The first step in the creation of the software system is a prototype system in Java for testing the system design. 
The initial phase is to create a set of interacting Java classes for representing the Appointment Types, Patient details, and Appointment records.
In particular, you will create and test the following Java classes. 
  
    • A class named Patient that will encapsulate information relating to the patients who wish to book a dental Treatment or a Check-Up. 
    • A class called AppointmentType and subclasses called Treatment and CheckUp that will encapsulate information and details about different types of dental Appointments. 
    • An enumerated type called TreatmentType. 
    • A class called Appointment to encapsulate a patient, an appointment type and a time. 
      
The second stage in the development of the software that will run the system is to design and implement a GUI that makes use of the hierarchy of 
interacting classes described above. The GUI should incorporate functionality that allows the user to:

    • Add details of new Treatments and Check-Ups options;
    • Add details of patients who wish to arrange appointments; 
    • View, and manage a list of available treatments and check-ups, a list of patients, and a list of currently arranged appointments; 
    • Sort appointments according to several specified criteria.
